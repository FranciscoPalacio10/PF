<p>Para iniciar con este proceso se realiza la conexión a la base de datos utilizando el driver ODBC y con el método que se muestra a continuación:</p>

<p>Una vez obtenida la conexión se procede a obtener la vista generada en la base de datos y se asigna a una variable llamada “DfDatosPrestamos” que es del tipo Data Frame:</p>

<p>Se observa que al remplazar los valores nulos, vacios o ceros donde no era posible este valor, se mantiene la distribución y se ve afectado levemente el promedio de las variables, pero al ser este un minino impacto se llega a la conclusión de que este método es valido para poder realizar modelos de predicción.</p>

<p>Para el resto del proceso se seleccionan los préstamos que tengan una existencia de al menos noventa días, para poder determinar si una persona es morosa o no al momento del análisis.</p>
<p>Los préstamos menores a noventa días se podrían utilizar una vez obtenido el modelo entrenado y evaluado.</p>
